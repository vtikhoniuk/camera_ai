## Possible Issues and Solutions

### Web Version

#### "Camera permission denied"
- Allow camera access in browser
- Check that site is not blocked in browser settings
- Use HTTPS for production version

#### "Camera not found"
- Make sure camera is connected and not used by other applications
- Reload page and re-allow access

#### OpenAI API errors in browser
- Use HTTPS for production (OpenAI requires secure connection)
- Check CORS settings
- Make sure API key is correct

### Mobile Version

#### "Camera permission denied"
- Allow camera access in app settings
- Reinstall app if permissions are not requested

#### App won't start
- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear cache: `npx expo start --clear`

## Web Version Deployment

### For static hosting:
```bash
npm run build
```

### For GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Important for production:
- Use HTTPS
- Configure CORS headers
- Ensure API key security

## Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: 
- Never commit `config.js` file with real API keys
